3D Ulam Spiral is an academic project at the University of Paris-Saclay. realized in [Processing](https://processing.org), which aims at representing in 3D the distribution of prime, deficit, perfect and abundant numbers.

Two geometric models, a pyramid and a cube, are composed of subcubes associated with a number *n*. The values of the subcubes are the images by the second degree polynomial associated to the models.

## Functionalities
To make it easier to view the models, it is possible to :
- Control the speed and axis of rotation
- Manually control the vue with the mouse (click and drag)
- Change the coefficients of the second degree polynomials



To use this program, run the file [PROJET.pde] with all the .pde and .glsl files in a sketch of Processing.
